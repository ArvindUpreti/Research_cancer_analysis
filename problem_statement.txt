Comprehensive EDA and Inferential Analysis on Large-Scale Patient Dataset….


Project Vision
This project harnesses the power of advanced analytics and global health data to uncover actionable insights into cancer care, outcomes, and disparities. Using a robust dataset of 50,000 cancer patient records collected from multiple countries between 2015 and 2024, we aim to bridge the gap between raw data and life-saving decisions.

What the Data Covers
Our dataset offers a 360-degree view of cancer patient profiles, including:
Demographics: Age, gender, country, year of diagnosis.
Genetic & Lifestyle Risks: Genetic predisposition, smoking, alcohol use, obesity
Environmental Exposure: Air pollution
Clinical & Economic Variables: Cancer type, stage, treatment cost
Patient Outcomes: Survival years, severity scores



Core Objectives
🔎 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Identify key trends, hidden patterns, and relationships
Visualize disparities in diagnosis, lifestyle, treatment, and outcomes
Highlight variations across countries, age groups, and cancer stages


2. Inferential & Predictive Analytics
Using statistical methods, we’ll explore and answer critical healthcare questions:
Determine the relationship between risk factors and cancer severity
Analyze the proportion of early-stage diagnoses by cancer type
Identify key predictors of cancer severity and survival years
Explore the economic burden of cancer treatment across different demographics and countries
Assess whether higher treatment cost is associated with longer survival
Evaluate if higher cancer stages lead to greater treatment costs and reduced survival years
Examine whether higher genetic risk amplifies the negative effects of smoking on cancer severity and survival outcomes.

3. Insight Extraction and Documentation
For each major analysis, we will draw clear, evidence-backed inferences
All findings will be systematically documented for future clinical, academic, and operational use
Each insight will be linked to real-world implications—to guide decision-making and policy formulation
